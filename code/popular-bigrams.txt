/*
This Pig script picks out, for each year, the single bigram that occurs most often:
1. Load the tab separated bigram data with its schema.
2. Keep only year, bigram, and occurrence count.
3. Group the data by year.
4. Inside each year group, sort by count descending and grab the top record.
5. Write out (year, bigram, count) to HDFS.

-- Step 1: Load the TSV input
A = LOAD '/user/admin/data/googlebooks-eng-2gram.txt'
    USING PigStorage('\t')
    AS (
        bigram:chararray,   -- the two word phrase
        year:int,           -- publication year
        occ:int,            -- number of occurrences that year
        pages:int,          -- pages it appears on
        books:int           -- books it appears in 
    );

-- Step 2: Projects only the columns we care about (year, bigram, count)
B = FOREACH A GENERATE
        year   AS yr,   -- year
        bigram AS bg,   -- bigram
        occ    AS cnt;  -- count

-- Step 3: Group all records by year so we can find the top bigram per group
C = GROUP B BY yr;

-- Step 4: Within each year group, sort by count descending and keep only the top record
D = FOREACH C {
        sorted = ORDER B BY cnt DESC;  -- highest count first
        top1   = LIMIT sorted 1;       -- take the single top bigram
        GENERATE FLATTEN(top1);        -- emit (yr, bg, cnt)
    };

-- Step 5: Store the final (year, bigram, count) tuples to the output directory
STORE D INTO '/user/admin/data/popular-bigrams-output';
